 Approach          | Time   | Space | Comment 
-------------------|--------|-------|-----------
Simple Recurtion   | O(2^n) | O(1)  | Very slow for large n due to exponential time complexity. 
Memoization        | O(n)   | O(n)  | Faster than simple recursion but uses additional space for caching.
Tabulation         | O(n)   | O(1)  | Same time complexity as memoization, but uses constant space.
